# @fullstack-starter/api-client

A typed API client generated from the backend OpenAPI schema.

- Types are generated by `openapi-typescript`
- Client is powered by `openapi-fetch`

## Codegen

Ensure the backend is running (or the script will try to start it) and run:

```
pnpm --filter @fullstack-starter/api-client run codegen
```

This will:
- Fetch OpenAPI schema from `http://localhost:3000/docs/json`
- Write `src/openapi.json`
- Generate types at `src/schema.ts`
- Create a thin client wrapper at `src/client.ts`

## Usage

In a frontend app:

```ts
import createClient from '@fullstack-starter/api-client';

const client = createClient({ baseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL });

// Example request
const { data, error } = await client.GET('/auth/me');
```

The client includes credentials by default and triggers `onUnauthorized` when a 401 response is received.
